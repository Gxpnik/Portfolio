                    Hello! My name is Rodrigo and I'm a 20-year-old who loves to learn new things every day. I'm always striving to improve myself with no limits to what I can achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not studying, you can usually find me indulging in my two favorite hobbies: gaming and learning at my own pace. I have a passion for operating systems, especially Linux, and enjoy helping others fix their IT problems. Not only does it help them,
                    but it also allows me to continue learning in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also a big animal lover and have a soft spot for cats. I love spending time with my furry friends and playing with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I believe in living life to the fullest and experiencing everything that the world has to offer.
                </p>
